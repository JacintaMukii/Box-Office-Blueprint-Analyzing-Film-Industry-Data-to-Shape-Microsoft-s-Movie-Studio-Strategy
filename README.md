# Phase_1_project
# Project Overview
For this project, exploratory data analysis was used to generate insights for a business stakeholder.

## Business Problem
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.



## Main Objectives
Exploring the data collected from movie sites then translating those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## Specific Objectives
1.To get the most popular genres

2.To check the most popular studios

3.To use the domestic gross to estimate budget used and how it affects the ratings.

## What has been explored in this project:

1.Which genre has the highest number of production ?

2.What are some of the most common studios used in production ?

2.Does the domestic gross(budget) affect the ratings ?

3.What are the correlations of different genres and other attributes ?

## Conclusions

We have drawn many interesting inferences from the dataset,here's a summary of the few of them:

The most genre type is drama with the least as war,

The amount of Domestic Gross/Budget does affect the rating of the movie,

Some Genre Combinations are more relatable to each other unlike others.

The number of votes also affect the rating of the movie.

## Recommendations

The studios that should be invested in should be either Universal, IFC or Fox.

The company should consider starting with the production of drama genre movies.

The company should conduct a survey to see which movies are popular.
